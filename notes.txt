- Projects and Stacks
- Stacks = different instances of infrastucture
- Stack export and import to migrate between backends
- State is stored in checkpoints (transactional snapshot) - records often and early - easy to recover from failure
- Default Naming uses random ids as postfix for names (so multiple stacks can be created in same env)
- Local backed uses flat structure - so stacks
- With Pulumi backend, the AWS calls are still made from the client unlike TFE model
- Get static functions = datasource
- Provider functions are general utility functions
 - apigateway.LookupDomainName
- Outputs are promises - special operations to use outputs for concatenation etc. (pulumi.Sprintf, pulumi.concat, etc)

- Encryption provider
